Hi, and thank you for downloads the Interior Fantasy Tileset!

Made by: S Frisk

I've been wanting to flex my pixel art muscles, and this is the first of hopefully many tile sets I'll be uploading here.

This tileset was based on the Lost Century Palette on Lospec. (https://lospec.com/palette-list/lost-century)

If there is interest in this tileset, I can continue continue adding additional features.

License:

- You can modify the assets
- You cannot redistribute or resale, even if modifed, the contents of this tileset.
- You can use these assets in non-commercial/commercial projects, but please credit me! (S. Frisk: https://sfrisk.itch.io/)

If you enjoy this asset pack, please let me know!
