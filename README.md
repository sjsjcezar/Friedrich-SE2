## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Description
**Friedrich** is a Unity-based 2D RPG that includes:
- A **turn-based combat system** inspired by classic JRPGs. (Yes, including attacking, skills and using potions)
- Dynamic AI Enemies (They attack, they cast a skill or even heal in an absurd rate >:) )
- A **leveling system** using Fate Crystals to scale stats like HP, MP, and resistances.
- An ** inventory system** that allows weapon equipping, stat scaling, and restrictions based on player class.
- **UI Systems**: Pause Menu, Stat Display, and interactive inventory interface.
- **Open world exploration** and environmental storytelling with dynamic lighting and transitions.
- JSON-based save/load integration (Still buggy!)
- Quest System and Rewards!
